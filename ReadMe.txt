The player is moved by using the arrow keys.
The point of the game is to eat all the dots on the board while avoiding being eaten by the ghosts chasing you.
If you eat any of the small blue rhombuses on the board you enter hunter mode and can then eat the ghosts.
Going through the openings in either side pops you out on the other side of the board. Useful for eascaping the ghosts.
Each ghost has its own way of chasing the player, learning how each one behaves will give you the upper edge in escaping them. Good luck.
